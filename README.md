# README - Website Project

Welcome to my website project! This is an exciting endeavor where I am building my own website using HTML and uploading the code to GitHub. Here's some information about this project:

## Project Overview
- This project aims to showcase my creativity, interests, and skills through a personal website.
- The website will consist of multiple pages, including a homepage, about me section, projects showcase, and contact information.
- I am using HTML to structure the content and CSS for styling and visual enhancements.
- I am also using Google Analytics to understand who is visiting my website, from where are they connecting and how long are they at it. 

## Project Structure
- The main HTML file is `index.html`, which serves as the homepage of my website.
- The CSS file is named `style.css` and is located in the `css` folder.
- Any additional pages should be created as separate HTML files and linked accordingly.

## How to View the Website

Go to this website in your browser: www.smritikulkarni.com OR follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the homepage.
3. Navigate through the different pages using the navigation links.

## Contributions and Feedback
- I'm open to any suggestions or feedback on improving the website design, functionality, or content.
- Feel free to reach out to me if you have any ideas or would like to collaborate.

## Thank You
- Thank you for taking the time to explore my website project! I hope you enjoy browsing through the pages and getting to know me better.

**Note:** This project is an ongoing effort, and I will be updating and adding new features with assistance from my dad over time. Stay tuned for exciting updates!
